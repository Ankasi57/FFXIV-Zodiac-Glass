FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass
==================

## What is FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass?
A tiny Final Fantasy XIV overlay that allows you to observe the progress of your Nexus and Zeta weapons.

## Who can use it?
You have to play in frameless window mode to use this overlay. 
I can implement a version that supports the window mode too, but not for one person.

## How to use it?
Only download the program and run it. No you should see a tiny overlay if you have equipped a supported weapon like this:

## How to change the position?
You can change the position by simple dragging it.

## How to change the display mode?
You can change it by clicking on the class icon or the light amount value.
Currently there a two modes:
  - simple points value
  - percentage value
