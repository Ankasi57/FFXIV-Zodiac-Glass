FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass
==================

## THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER FULL SUPPORTED!!!
I will no longer update the memory addresses automatically.

But I will update those if I get multiple requests for it.

DirectX 11 is also not supported!!!

## avast Free Antivirus
Its possible that avast Free Antivirus (maybe also other antivirus software) will interrupt this process and will never release the process. If that happens you have to restart your pc and define an exception rule for the FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass exe.

## What is FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass?
A tiny Final Fantasy XIV overlay that allows you to observe the progress of your Nexus and Zeta weapons.

## Who can use it?
You have to play in a window mode to use this overlay. 

## How to use it?
Only download the program and run it. Now you should see a tiny overlay if you have equipped a supported weapon like this:

<img title="Zodiac Overlay" src="https://github.com/MartinKuschnik/FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass/blob/master/doc/pics/overlay_zodiac.jpg" />
<img title="Zeta Overlay" src="https://github.com/MartinKuschnik/FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass/blob/master/doc/pics/overlay_zeta.jpg" />

## How to change the position?
You can change the position by simple dragging it.

## How to change the display mode?
You can change it by clicking on the class icon or the light amount value.
Currently there a two modes:
  - simple points value
  - percentage value

## How to download it?
