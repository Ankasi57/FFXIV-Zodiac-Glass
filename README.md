FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass
==================

## THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER FULL SUPPORTED!!!
I will no longer update the memory addresses automatically.
But I will update those if I get multiple requests for it.

## What is FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass?
A tiny Final Fantasy XIV overlay that allows you to observe the progress of your Nexus and Zeta weapons.

## Who can use it?
You have to play in [frameless] window mode to use this overlay. 

## How to use it?
Only download the program and run it. Now you should see a tiny overlay if you have equipped a supported weapon like this:

<img title="Zodiac Overlay" src="https://github.com/InvisibleShield/FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass/blob/master/doc/pics/overlay_zodiac.jpg" />
<img title="Zeta Overlay" src="https://github.com/InvisibleShield/FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass/blob/master/doc/pics/overlay_zeta.jpg" />

## How to change the position?
You can change the position by simple dragging it.

## How to change the display mode?
You can change it by clicking on the class icon or the light amount value.
Currently there a two modes:
  - simple points value
  - percentage value

## How to download it?
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/InvisibleShield/FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass/releases) and download the current version.
