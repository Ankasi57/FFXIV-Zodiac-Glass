FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass
==================

## THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER FULL SUPPORTED!!!
I will no longer update the memory addresses automatically.

But I will update those if I get multiple requests for it.

DirectX 11 is also not supported!!!

## What is FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass?
A tiny Final Fantasy XIV overlay that allows you to observe the progress of your Nexus and Zeta weapons.

## Who can use it?
You have to play in a window mode to use this overlay. 

## How to use it?
Only download the program and run it. Now you should see a tiny overlay if you have equipped a supported weapon like this:

<img title="Zeta Overlay" src="https://github.com/MartinKuschnik/FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass/blob/master/doc/pics/overlay_zeta.jpg" />

## How to change the position?
You can change the position by simple dragging it.

## How to change the display mode?
You can change it by clicking on the class icon or the light amount value.
Currently there a two modes:
  - simple points value
  - percentage value

## How to download it?
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/MartinKuschnik/FFXIV-Zodiac-Glass/releases) and download the current version.

## Troubleshooting
- The program does not start (No Tray Icon visible):

    - Please check your antivir software. (We saw this issue by users of avast Free Antivirus. Please create a wildcard and restart your system if you have this problem.)
    
- You can not see any overlay:

  - If you use the overlay in pinned mode (recommended) please check whether you have installed [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/download/details.aspx?id=48130) or a later version.

  - Use the assistent to track down the reason.
